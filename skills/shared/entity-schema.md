# Entity Schema

Merged reference combining entity type hierarchy, frontmatter
schemas, and per-type attribute tables for all campaign entities.

## System-Specific Guidance

Schemas here are system-agnostic. For system-specific stat
blocks, skill formats, and mechanical conventions, also read:
- CoC 7e: `systems/coc-7e/occupations.md` (percentile stats)
- D&D 5e: `systems/dnd-5e-2024/conditions-rules.md` (CR, proficiency)
- GURPS 4e: `systems/gurps-4e/character-generation.md` (point-buy attributes)
- FitD: `systems/fitd/factions.md` (tier, hold, clocks)

## Universal Fields

Apply to **every** entity type. Enable temporal queries
("what changed in session 5?", "which entities are stale?").

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| lastUpdated | string | Session number or date of last modification |
| asOfSession | string | Session when current state was confirmed accurate |
| createdSession | string | Session when first introduced |
| source | string | How it entered canon: "play", "prep", or "backstory" |
| confidence | string | Canon confidence: DRAFT / AUTHORITATIVE / SUPERSEDED |

Always set `lastUpdated` and `asOfSession` to current session
when filing or updating.

Abstract types cannot be assigned directly to entities but are
used for constraint inheritance in the relationship ontology.

## Frontmatter Schemas

### Required Fields (All Entity Types)

```yaml
---
type: npc              # From the type hierarchy
source_confidence: DRAFT    # DRAFT | AUTHORITATIVE | SUPERSEDED | STUB
aliases: []
tags: []
source_document: ""
campaign: ""
first_appearance: ""   # Link to scene or session
---
```

### Relationships Block

```yaml
relationships:
  - target: "[[Target Entity Name]]"
    type: member_of       # From _meta/relationship-types.md
    tone: respectful      # friendly | romantic | respectful
                          # professional | hostile | fearful
                          # distrustful | contemptuous | neutral
                          # unknown | complicated
    strength: 7           # 1-10 (1-2 weak, 9-10 defining)
    bidirectional: false
    description: "Serves as lieutenant"
```

Extraction defaults:

- `tone: neutral` and `strength: 5` when source is ambiguous
- `bidirectional: false` unless inherently symmetric
- Include `description` traceable to source text

## Type-Specific Fields

NOTE: The Core Entity Types section above contains the detailed
attribute tables. This section is the compact summary used
during Dissect mode.

**NPC:** `occupation`, `age`, `gender`, `nationality`, `status`
(alive/dead/missing/unknown), `portrait` (optional)

**PC:** `player_name`, `occupation`, `age`, `gender`, `nationality`,
`status` (alive/dead/missing/unknown), `key_traits`, `portrait` (optional),
`display_meta` (optional array: ordered field names for published site meta row;
defaults to `[occupation, age, nationality]` when omitted)

### PC Body Structure

All PC entity files follow this canonical heading hierarchy.
Templates in `shared/templates/` implement the full structure
per system; skills that create or update PC files follow the
same skeleton.

```text
## Stat Sheet          — system-specific stats (always first body section)
## Background          — backstory, personality, description
## [System Sections]   — varies by system (see per-system template)
## Equipment           — gear, possessions, wealth/encumbrance
## Notes               — player-facing (protected: skills never modify)
## GM Notes            — keeper-only (protected: skills never modify)
```

Templates may omit inapplicable sections (e.g., FitD crews
have no `## Equipment` — gear is handled through Quality).

`## Notes` and `## GM Notes` are **protected sections** — only
the GM edits them directly. Automated skills must preserve
their content unchanged.

### Story Companion Convention

Every PC entity `Characters/PCs/{Name}.md` may have a
companion story file at `Characters/PCs/{Name}_Story.md`.

- Frontmatter: `type: character-story`,
  `character: "[[{Name}]]"`, plus universal fields
- Discovered by naming convention (`{Name}_Story.md`),
  not frontmatter pointer
- Append-only — new sessions add a `## Session {N} — {Session Title}` heading
- `campaign-qa` validates every active PC has a story file
- See `shared/character-story-format.md` for narrative voice,
  genre matching, and append protocol

**Location:** `location_type`, `parent_location` (wiki-link),
`atmosphere`, `portrait` (optional)

**Faction/Organization:** `faction_type` (cult, guild, military,
etc.), `goals`, `leadership` (wiki-link), `territory` (wiki-link),
`portrait` (optional)

**Item:** `item_type` (weapon, armor, relic, etc.),
`current_holder` (wiki-link), `origin`, `portrait` (optional)

**Event:** `event_type` (battle, ritual, etc.), `in_game_date` (in-game),
`location` (wiki-link), `participants` (wiki-links), `outcome`

**Clue:** `clue_type` (physical, testimonial, documentary),
`found_at` (wiki-link), `found_by`, `leads_to`, `reliability`

**Creature:** `creature_type` (beast, undead, aberration, etc.),
`location` (wiki-link), `abilities`, `weaknesses`, `portrait` (optional)

## Relationship Types

Use the most specific type available. Generic types like
`associated_with` or `related_to` add edges without meaning.

| Category | Types |
|----------|-------|
| Kinship | parent_of, sibling_of, spouse_of, betrothed_to, ancestor_of |
| Social | knows, friend_of, rival_of, mentors, trusts, betrayed |
| Power | rules, employs, commands, serves, vassal_of, imprisons |
| Spatial | located_at, headquartered_at, part_of, borders, haunts |
| Possession | owns, created, wields, seeks |
| Knowledge | discovered, conceals, recorded_in, studies |
| Conflict | enemy_of, allied_with, at_war_with, conspires_against |
| Affiliation | member_of, founded, leads, defected_from, infiltrates |
| Supernatural | bound_to, cursed_by, summoned, worships, corrupted_by |
| Temporal | caused, triggered, participated_in, witnessed |
| Economic | trades_with, supplies, finances, indebted_to |
| Event | murdered, poisoned, wounded, rescued, captured, deceived |
| Horror | possessed_by, infected_by, fears, feeds_on |
| Romance | courts, rejected, disguised_as, blackmails |
| Historical | conquered, exiled_from, succeeded, negotiated_with |
| Sci-Fi | uploaded_to, augmented_by, cloned_from, hacked |
| Superhero | alter_ego_of, empowered_by, nemesis_of |

Each type has an `inverse` name. Storage is single-direction only.
If you record `A --[employs]--> B`, the inverse
`B --[employed_by]--> A` is implied. Do NOT store both.

**Symmetric types** (stored once, no direction):
knows, sibling_of, spouse_of, betrothed_to, enemy_of, allied_with,
rival_of, friend_of, borders, trades_with, alter_ego_of, nemesis_of

**Genre tags:** Each type carries tags: `universal`, `fantasy`,
`horror`, `scifi`, `superhero`, `historical`, `romance`. Filter
suggestions to match the campaign's genre.

For domain/range constraints and the full inverse name list,
consult `relationship-patterns.md` in the ttrpg-expert skill.

## Required Relationships

| Entity Type | Required Relationship |
|-------------|----------------------|
| `npc` | `located_at` |
| `pc` | `located_at` |
| `creature` | `located_at` |
| `faction` | `headquartered_at` |
| `organization` | `headquartered_at` |

## Default Folder Mapping

| Type Category | Vault Folder |
|---------------|-------------|
| pc | Characters/PCs/ |

## Vault Configuration Fields

The vault's `_meta/vault-config.md` file uses YAML frontmatter
for campaign-wide settings. These fields are read by multiple
skills.

### Core fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `gm_apprentice_version` | string | Plugin version this vault was last migrated to. Set by the migration system. Skills compare this to `current_version` in `shared/migrations.md` to detect when migration is needed. |
| `setting_year` | string | In-game date displayed on the published site |

### Publish fields (under `publish:` key)

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `system` | string | Game system identifier (`coc-7e`, `coc-7e-regency`, `gurps-4e`, `dnd-5e-2024`, `fitd`). Read by publish tool for system-specific rendering. |
| `site_dir` | string | Absolute path to the site repo directory. Read by publish-site skill instead of asking each session. Optional — omit if vault doesn't use the publish tool. |
| `mode` | string | `"player"` or `"full"` — controls GM-only content visibility |
| `exclude_sections` | array | H2 heading names to strip from published output (default: `["GM Notes"]`) |
| `exclude_fields` | array | Frontmatter field names to strip (default: `["secrets", "current_plan", "plan_progress"]`) |
| `exclude_dirs` | array | Vault folders to exclude from publishing (default: `["_meta", "_Templates"]`) |
| `theme` | object | Theme configuration: `genre`, `palette`, `fonts`, `campaign_image` |
| `four_oh_four` | object | Custom 404 page: `style`, `message` |
| `overrides` | object | Per-file include/exclude/field overrides |
